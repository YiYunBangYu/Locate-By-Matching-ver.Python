    This program mainly tried to locate a drone's geomatric coordinate by the images it takes and a giving tiff image, which is able to find its latitude and longitude, and caculate its height and the photographing angle when the image was taken.
    When I undertook this project professor Liu had developed a kit of code in Matlab and it can predict the data of latitude and longtitude precisely. What I did is to try to transfer the origional code to python code and do the height prediction, which I've finished the theory now but when implecating it's stiil not really rubust.
    The next version will add cuda acceleration, and do height prediction better.
